uKinectonitor [WIP - ON HOLD]

This is an update to Brady Gaster's excellent demo application, The Kinectonitor, for Microsoft Kinect SDK Beta.

uKinectonitor hopes to add support for Kinect Managed SDK version 1, as well as a general refactoring facelift.

While there is almost no trace of the original Kinectonitor code left, it was the jumping-off point I originally
referenced when I first began working with the Kinect SDK to build a comprehensive home security system. As
there haven't been many quick, clean, and easy example applications built with the managed SDK releases, this
project hopes to give back with a fully updated implementation of The Kinectonitor, along with a few added
freebie features.
